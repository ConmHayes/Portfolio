        <p>
        I am a 2023 BSc graduate of the University of Hertfordshire, where I read Physics, with a particular interesting in computer programming. I am a driven, conscientious person who prides himself on being punctual and the ability to tackle problems with persistence and resilience. Post being a university student, Iâ€™m eager to apply my knowledge in the real world and utilise skills I have learnt in previous jobs to expand my horizons further. I strive to achieve a highest standard as possible, in any given task or situation, a quality I would always bring to the workplace.
